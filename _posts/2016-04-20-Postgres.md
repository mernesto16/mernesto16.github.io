### Postgres SQL

Postgres was the main database software that we used throughout this corse. We would log in using a c9 workspace. Using postgres we were able to make databases, tables, and run queries.  

To start the service I would run this command:

```Python 
sudo service postgresql start

```
It is curcial to start the service inorder for all other operations to run. 

To login I would use this command 

``` Python
psql -U postgres -h localhost
```
The first step in using a database is obviously creating one. To create a database I would run this command

``` Python
CREATE DATABASE name;
```

This created a database with the given name. From there you can make tables, create users, run queries, etc.

``` Python
CREATE TABLE films (
    code        char(5) CONSTRAINT firstkey PRIMARY KEY,
    title       varchar(40) NOT NULL,
    did         integer NOT NULL,
    date_prod   date,
    kind        varchar(10),
    len         interval hour to minute
);
```
This is directly from the PostgreSQL website and makes a table with several different fields.
