### Rate My Histroy

This project was a team project where we had to all work together to create a website that can be used to fulfill a purpose relevant to students. We developed a website similar to Rate My Professor but instead rated historical events. We chose to do this topic because it provides an easy way to pick a research or thesis topic that interests you. We used Python, JavaScript, html, and CSS to develop the website. SocketIO was implemented to run login, add events, suggest events, and a chat room. 

### Our Database

We had to develop a database that contained all of our historical events. Users could suggest or add events (dependent on privileges) to the database. 

``` Python

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS events;
CREATE TABLE events (
    ID serial NOT NULL,
    Name varchar(50)  NOT NULL default '',
    Location varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
    Description varchar(500) NOT NULL default '',
    Year date,
    Rating integer,
    Views integer NOT NULL default 0,
    PRIMARY KEY  (ID)
) ;

INSERT INTO events (Name, Location, Description, Year, Views) Values
