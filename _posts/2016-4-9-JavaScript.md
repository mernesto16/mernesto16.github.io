JavaScirpt was pretty hard for me to grasp this semester. One of the problems I found was that it was to forgiving of a scripting language. By this I mean that it would allow functions to run even if they werenâ€™t written as well as they could be. This would cause confusion and also slow down processing speeds. The main way we used JavaScript this semester was when creating a login in ability to a website. The most confusing Java Script code that I developed was the one for searching for something specified by a user. 

### Examples 

```Python 
    
    $scope.search = function search(){
        console.log('Searching', $scope.find)
        socket.emit('search', $scope.find);
        $scope.find = '';
        console.log('Found:', $scope.find )
    }

```
This allowed a user to search based on pre-specified requirements. 

### Helful Links
