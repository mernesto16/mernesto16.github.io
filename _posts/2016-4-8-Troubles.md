title: My Troubles!
---

The hardest part about this class for me was trying to figure out everything just by watching videos and searching the internet. I would have felt more comfortable having started with a backbone of comprehension and working solo from there. BUT this being said, it was a class that did prepare you for the real world and that was a bonus. If I could go back and talk to my past self I would say to start asking questions right out of the gate and don’t wait to start projects. Procrastination will kill you in this class so don’t let it get the better of you. Have fun learning new things and working with classmates. Nearly all of you are in the same boat so it’s kind of nice to team up to solve problems. 

The hardest project for me was definitely the SocketIO work. It took me ages to grasp the concept of connecting different languages in different files together to form one cohesive program. 

Below are three pictures of my SocketIO code. The first is the python file, the second is the html file, and the third is tmy JavaScript file.
